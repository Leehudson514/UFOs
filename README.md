# UFOs

## Overview
* The purpose of this project was to use Javascript and html to create a website for a client that will allow users to search/filter data to analyze it to decide for themselves if UFOs exist.

## Results
* UFO data is filtered by the user through entering the desired information within the correct search criteria and pressing "Enter".
* Search criteria can be done through the following:
    * Filter by Date (MM/DD/YYYY)
    * Filter by City ("benton")
    * Filter by State ("ca")
    * Filter by Country ("us")
    * Filter by Shape ("circle")

## Summary
* **Website drawbacks:**
    * Filtering is case sensitive and needs to match EXACTLY how it is within the database.
        * No results will appear if the search criteria is not exact.
    * Website has no external links to sightings
        * Users are not able to verify where the source is coming from and can not share it with others. 
* **Website Recommendations:**
   * Making exceptions for search criteria to have search results pull back the desired results regardless of capitalization.
   * Have the search filters propose search results to help guide the user to navigate the database more easily.
